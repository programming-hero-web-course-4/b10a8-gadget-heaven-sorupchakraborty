## üöÄ React Fundamentals Used

In this project, we utilized several core React concepts to enhance performance, maintainability, and user experience:

1. **Components**: Reusable components like Navbar, Footer, ProductCard, and Modal for consistency across pages.
2. **React Router**: For navigating between pages and handling routes, including a custom 404 page.
3. **Hooks**: Utilized `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useNavigate`, and `useLocation` for state management and navigation.
4. **Context API**: Managed global state for cart and wishlist to ensure efficient data flow.
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Showed specific components based on user actions, like showing toast messages when items are added to the cart or wishlist.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Management

We used **Context API** to manage data flow, such as handling cart and wishlist items across components. For persistence, **LocalStorage** was implemented to ensure cart and wishlist data remains available even after page reloads.
